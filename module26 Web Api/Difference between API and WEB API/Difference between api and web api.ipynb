    "Difference between API and Web API ?\n",
    "\n",
    "API (Application Programming Interface) is a general term that refers to a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. It can be used for various purposes, such as integrating third-party services, retrieving data from databases, or enabling functionality in applications. APIs can be accessed using different communication protocols, such as HTTP, REST, SOAP, or GraphQL.\n",
    "Web API, on the other hand, specifically refers to APIs that are designed to be accessed over the internet using standard web protocols. Web APIs typically use HTTP as the communication protocol and are often designed using architectural styles such as REST (Representational State Transfer) or SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol). They allow developers to access and manipulate data or services provided by another application or server over the web. Web APIs can return data in various formats, such as JSON or XML, and are commonly used for integrating third-party services, retrieving data from databases, or enabling functionality in web applications.\n",
    "In summary, while API is a broad term that encompasses any set of rules and protocols for communication between software applications, Web API specifically refers to APIs that are designed to be accessed over the internet using standard web protocols."
