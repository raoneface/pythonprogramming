    "What is Restful service?\n",
    "\n",
    "A RESTful service, also known as a RESTful API (Application Programming Interface), is a web service that adheres to the principles of Representational State Transfer (REST). REST is an architectural style for designing networked applications, and it relies on a stateless, client-server communication model.\n",
    "In a RESTful service, resources are identified by URLs (Uniform Resource Locators), and clients interact with these resources using standard HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc. The service typically returns data in a format like JSON or XML.\n",
    "Key characteristics of a RESTful service include:\n",
    "1. Stateless: Each request from a client to the server must contain all the information needed to understand and process the request. The server does not store any client context between requests.\n",
    "2. Client-Server Architecture: The client and server are separate entities that interact through a well-defined interface. The client is responsible for the user interface and user experience, while the server handles data storage and processing.\n",
    "3. Uniform Interface: RESTful services have a consistent and standardized way of accessing resources, making it easier for clients to interact with the service.\n",
    "4. Resource-Based: Resources are the key abstraction in REST, and they are identified by URLs\n",
    "5. Stateless Communication: Each request from a client to the server must contain all the information needed to understand and process the request. The server does not store any client context between requests.\n",
    "6. Cacheable: Responses from the server can be marked as cacheable or non-cacheable, allowing clients to improve performance by caching responses when appropriate.\n",
    "7. Layered System: A RESTful service can be composed of multiple layers, such as load balancers, proxies, and gateways, which can help improve scalability and security.\n",
    "Overall, RESTful services are widely used in web development and are a popular choice for building APIs due to their simplicity, scalability, and ease of integration with various clients.\n",
