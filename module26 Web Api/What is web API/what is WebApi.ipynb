    "What is API?\n",
    "\n",
    "An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. It defines how requests and responses should be structured, enabling developers to access and manipulate data or services provided by another application or server. APIs can be used for various purposes, such as integrating third-party services, retrieving data from databases, or enabling functionality in applications. They can be accessed using different communication protocols, such as HTTP, REST, SOAP, or GraphQL. APIs play a crucial role in modern software development, as they allow developers to leverage existing services and data, and enable interoperability between different systems. They can be public (open to anyone) or private (restricted to specific users or applications), and can return data in various formats, such as JSON or XML. Overall, APIs are essential for enabling communication and integration between different software applications and services."

    "A Web API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other over the internet. It defines how requests and responses should be structured, enabling developers to access and manipulate data or services provided by another application or server. Web APIs are commonly used to integrate third-party services, retrieve data from databases, or enable functionality in web applications. They can be accessed using standard HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. Web APIs can be designed using various architectural styles, such as REST (Representational State Transfer) or SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol), and can return data in formats like JSON or XML. They play a crucial role in enabling communication and interoperability between different software systems on the web."
